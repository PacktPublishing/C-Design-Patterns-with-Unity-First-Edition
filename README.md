## About the book

Struggling to write maintainable and clean code for your Unity games? Look no further! Learning Design Patterns with Unity empowers you to harness the fullest potential of popular design patterns that will take your game development skills to the next level. With structured explanations backed with practical examples, you'll master creational patterns like Prototype to efficiently spawn enemies and delve into behavioral patterns like Observer to create reactive game mechanics. As you progress, you'll also identify the negative impacts of bad architectural decisions and understand how to overcome them with simple but effective practices.

By the end of this Unity book, the way you develop Unity games will change – you’ll adapt a more structured, scalable, and optimized process that will help you make that next leap in your career.

## Get to know the Author
**Harrison Ferrone** was born in Chicago, IL. Most days, you can find him creating instructional content for LinkedIn Learning or trying to learn something new. He holds various fancy looking pieces of paper from the University of Colorado at Boulder and Columbia College Chicago, and despite being a proud alumnus, most of these are stored in a basement somewhere. After a few years as an iOS developer at small start-ups, and one Fortune 500 company, he fell into a teaching career and never looked back. Throughout all this, he's bought many books, acquired a few cats, worked abroad, and continually wondered why Neuromancer isn't on more course syllabi.
